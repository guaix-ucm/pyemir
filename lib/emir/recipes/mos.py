class StareSpectraRecipe(EmirRecipe):
    '''Recipe for the reduction of multiobject spectroscopy.

    Recipe to reduce observations obtained in multiobject spectroscopy,
    considering different possibilities depending on the observing mode. In
    particular, the following observing modes are considered: stare spectra,
    dithered/nodded spectra, and offset spectra.

    The special flexibility of the Cold Slit Unit (CSU) allows to obtain slit
    configurations in which some of the individual
    slits can be perfectly aligned
    with some other slits. When these aligned slits
    are contiguous, they constitute
    what are going to be considered as **pseudo-long-slits**. In the particular
    case in which a given individual slit is not aligned with any other, the
    pseudo-long-slit will have the shortest length *Lslit*,
    the length of a single individual slit. In the rest of the cases,
    where the number of individual slits
    that are aligned consecutively is *Nslit*>1, the total length of the
    pseudo-long-slit will be *Nslit* x *Lslit*.

    In order to unambiguously proceed with
    a proper sky subtraction for different
    observing modes, a table specifying which pseudo-long-slits with *sky*
    spectra are associated to the pseudo-long-slits
    with *science* spectra must be
    provided. In addition, this table must specify
    the characteristics of the data
    obtained through each pseudo-long-slit. More precisely, in the case of
    *science* spectra, it must indicate whether the
    target is puntual or extended.
    The *sky* spectra must indicate the corresponding position and range
    (pixels along the slit, referred to the
    central pseudo-long-slit coordinates)
    of the valid sky regions. In this way, both *sky* and *science* spectra
    can be extracted from the same pseudo-long-slit, if this is required.

    The following possibilities must be considered at the time of creating the
    association table among pseudo-long-slits:

     * A single *sky* pseudo-long-slit can be associated to several *science*
       pseudo-long-slits.
     * The association between pseudo-long-slits is not restricted to
       pseudo-long-slits of the same spectroscopic image.
       For example, in the case of separate exposures
       for *science* and *sky* spectra, a given
       pseudo-long-slit can contain the *science* spectra in
       one exposure and the *sky* spectra in another exposure.
     * The configuration of the CSU must be identical when pseudo-long-slits of
       different images are associated.

    **Observing modes:**

     * Stare spectra
     * Dithered/Nodded spectra
     * Offset Spectra

    **Inputs:**

     * Science frames + [Sky Frames]
     * An indication of the observing mode: **stare spectra**,
       **dithered/nodded spectra**, or **offset spectra**. In the case of
       dithered/nodded spectra, the corresponding offsets must be indicated
       (these offsets must be integer and can be zero)
     * The table relating the associations among the different
       pseudo-long-slits and the *science* and *sky* intervals
       that will be extracted at the end of the data reduction
       (TBD if this table must be in
       the FITS header and/or in other format)
     * Master Dark
     * Bad pixel mask (BPM)
     * Non-linearity correction polynomials
     * Spectroscopic Master flat (twilight/dome flats)
     * Master background (thermal background, only in K band)
     * Exposure Time (must be the same in all the frames, TBD)
     * Airmass for each frame
     * Detector model (gain, RN, lecture mode)
     * Average extinction curve the spectral range
     * Response curve for each pseudo-long-slit.

    **Outputs:**

     * 2D image with two extensions: final 2D image and associated 2D variance
       image, before sky-subtaction (TBD)
     * Final sky-subtracted and extracted spectra. TBD the way in which these
       spectra (and associated variance spectra) will be arranged
       (single 2D image, individual 1D spectra in different FITS extensions,
       individual 1D FITS files for each pseudo-long-slit)

    **Procedure:**

    The reduction will be carried out by extracting the different
    pseudo-long-slits and following a *traditional* long-slit reduction,
    making the appropriate treatment for the sky subtraction. The basic steps
    must include:

     * Data modeling (if appropriate/possible) and variance frame creation
       (from first principles)

     * Correction of non-linearity

     * Dark correction: this step can be avoided in most cases, since the
       extracted sky spectra may contain that information. However,
       if observing modes with different exposure times
       for *science* and *sky* frames are allowed, this correction may
       be necessary.

     * Flatfielding: distinguish between high frequency (pixel-to-pixel) and
       low-frequency (overall response and slit illumination) corrections.
       Lamp flats are adequate for the former and twilight flats
       for the second.

     * Detection and extraction of slits: apply Border_Detection
       algorithm, from own frames or from flatfields.

     * Cleaning

       * Single spectroscopic image: sigma-clipping algorithm removing
         local background in pre-defined direction(s).
       * Multiple spectroscopic images: sigma-clipping from comparison between
         frames.

     * Wavelength calibration and C-distortion correction of each slit.
       Double-check with available sky lines.

     * Sky-subtraction (number of sources/slit will be allowed to be > 1?).

       * Subtraction using sky signal at the borders of the same slit.
       * Subtraction using sky signal from other(s) slit(s), not necessarily
         adjacent.

     * Spectrophotometric calibration of each slit, using the
       extinction correction curve and the master spectrophotometric
       calibration curve.

     * Spectra extraction: define optimal, average, peak, FWHM.
