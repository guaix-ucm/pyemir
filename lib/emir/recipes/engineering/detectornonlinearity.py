'''Detector Nonlinearity Recipe.

Recipe to calibrate the detector nonlinearity.

**Observing modes:**

 * Not considered

**Inputs:**

 * A list of dome flat fields with the adequate exposure times.

**Outputs:**

 * The polynomial in a given format (TBD)

**Procedure:**

The median of the reduced flatfields is computed. For each exposure time, the
average and standard deviation of the ADUs is computed. A linear fit is
computed for the lowest ADU counts, with standard deviations as weights. A new
fit is performed, this time of ADU_linear/ADU_obs, versus ADU_obs. The
polynomial terms of the fit are computed.
