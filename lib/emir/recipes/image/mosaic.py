    The effect of recording a series of stare images, with the same
    acquisition parameters, and taken by pointing to a number of
    sky positions, with separations of the order of the EMIR FOV.
    This command is designed to fully cover a given area on the
    sky, but can also be used to point to a number of sky positions
    on which acquisition is only made at the beginning. Supersky
    frame(s) can be built from the image series.
