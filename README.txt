EMIR is a wide-field, near-infrared, multi-object spectrograph proposed 
for the Nasmyth focus of GTC. It will allow observers to obtain from tens to 
hundreds of intermediate resolution spectra simultaneously, in the 
nIR bands Z, J, H and K. A multi-slit mask unit will be used for target acquisition. 
EMIR is designed to address the science goals of the proposing team and 
of the Spanish community at large.
